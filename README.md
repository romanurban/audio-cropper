# Micro Audio Cropper

A 100 % client-side tool (WaveSurfer + ffmpeg.wasm) that lets you
upload an audio file, visually select a region, and download the trimmed
segmentâ€”no server, no upload, no privacy worries.

**Usage**

1. Drop a WAV, MP3, or OGG file.
2. Drag to select.
3. Press **Crop & Download**.

Everything runs inside the browser; the audio never leaves your machine.
