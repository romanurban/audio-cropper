# Micro Audio Cropper

A lightweight client-side tool that lets you trim audio directly in the browser. It uses vanilla JavaScript and the Web Audio API to display a waveform, allow selection, and export the chosen segment as a WAV fileâ€”no server interaction required.

## Usage

1. Open `index.html` in a modern browser.
2. Drag & drop a WAV, MP3 or OGG file onto the page (or click **Choose Audio File**).
3. Drag on the waveform to select a portion of the audio.
4. Use the playback controls to preview your selection.
5. Click **Crop Selection** to download the trimmed audio.

All processing happens locally; your audio never leaves your device.
